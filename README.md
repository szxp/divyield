# divyield

I have read a book about how to select stocks that pay enough dividends to build a good portfolio. This project helps me find those stocks. The financial data are provided by the IEX Cloud data provider.

## Version 1

The first version is a CLI tool that downloads financial data from IEX Cloud, caches the data in a PostgreSQL database and finds good enough stocks.

Create the PostgreSQL database using the `postgres/scripts/createdb.sql` file.

Pull financial data (such as splits, prices and dividends):

```
divyield pull
```

Find good enough stocks:
```
sh stats.sh
```

Example stats.sh output:
```
